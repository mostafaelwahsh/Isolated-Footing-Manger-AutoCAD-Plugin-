🔧 Isolated Footing Manager – AutoCAD Plugin (MVVM + WPF)
This is a plugin for AutoCAD designed to simplify the process of importing, drawing, and annotating isolated footings from an Excel sheet. Built with C#, WPF, and MVVM, it provides a user-friendly interface and integrates seamlessly into your CAD workflow.

🚀 Features
📂 Excel Integration
Import footing data (coordinates, dimensions, depths) directly from a structured Excel file.

📐 Draw Footings Automatically
Draws both plain concrete (PC) and reinforced concrete (RC) rectangles at specified positions in Model Space.

🔖 Auto Tagging Support
Optionally places numbered tags (e.g., F1, F2...) centered above footings in red-circled labels.

📊 Draw Excel Table
If enabled, the Excel sheet is also rendered as a CAD Table with proper alignment, styling, and custom header color (#FFD150).

🧱 Footing Section Sample Drawing
A sample section view of a footing (with column and rebars) is drawn with dimension lines indicating width and depth.

🖼️ Image Insertion
Optionally inserts a technical sketch/image into AutoCAD from a fixed path.
